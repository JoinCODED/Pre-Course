# Functions

## [Function Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8MPXUktK_viz0AO2Vqu4WKPrCiWLh7CGbiKrTztLcU/edit#slide=id.g78355d9c21_0_0)

## Function Basics

You can think of a function as a block of code with a name. You can run that block of code by typing the name, this way you can write the code once and reuse it multiple times.

Here's the syntax of a function:

```javascript
function funcName() {
  CODE;
}
```

Here's a simple example, with a single line:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

Now that we have it defined, we can actually _call_ the function so that it runs the code inside the function's block of code:

```javascript
helloWorld();
```

We can reuse the function's code by calling the function as many times as we want:

```javascript
helloWorld();
helloWorld();
helloWorld();
```

## [Function w/ Parameters Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8MPXUktK_viz0AO2Vqu4WKPrCiWLh7CGbiKrTztLcU/edit#slide=id.g44b02ef8a3_0_220)

## Function w/ Parameters

You can also think of it as an input and output. So the function with a name can receive parameters, then perform some operations, then give back an output. Those parantheses `()` are there to receive the parameters. Here's an example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  const result = a + b;
  return result;
}
```

In this code, the function receives two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameters are `let` variables, but their value comes from when the function is called, as you'll see next. What's written after the `return` keyword will be returned to where the function was called. Here's how you'd use such a function:

```javascript
const result = add(3, 5);
console.log(result); // 8
```

How this'll work is that the parameter `a` will be assigned the value `3`, because when calling the function we put the number `3` first, then second is number `5`, which will be assigned to the second parameter `b`. Then the `add()` function will add the two number resulting in `8`, then the number `8` will be _`return`ed_.

When the number `8` is _`return`ed_, the code will evaluate to this:

```javascript
const result = 8;
console.log(result); // 8
```

**_Where you called the function will be replaced with the value it returned._**

## A Bit on Naming Convention

You might notice a convention when naming functions and variables as we go on. Functions are usually _verbs_, because they usually perform a particular task or function (hence why they're called functions). So they're usually named as a verb, like our function `add()`, because it performs the task of *add*ing numbers together.

While variables are usually _nouns_. Like `result`. Because they're usually named after the data they contain.

## Variable Arguments

Let's expand on this a step further...

The values you pass to a function with parameters can be variables:

```javascript
const firstNumber = 15;
const secondNumber: 3;

const result = add(firstNumber, secondNumber);
console.log(result); // 45
```

The variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` being passed to the `add()` function are called _function **arguments**_. While the variables _inside_ the function, `a` and `b` are called _function **parameters**_.
