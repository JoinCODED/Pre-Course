## Function Basics

You can think of a function as a block of code with a name. You can run that block of code by typing the name, this way you can write the code once and reuse it multiple times.

Here's the syntax of a function:

```javascript
function funcName() {
  CODE;
}
```

Here's a simple example, with a single line:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

Now that we have it defined, we can actually _call_ the function so that it runs the code inside the function's block of code:

```javascript
helloWorld();
```

Review notes: missing concept: 
- Call the function more than one time to show that the function can be reused

## [Function w/ Parameters Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8MPXUktK_viz0AO2Vqu4WKPrCiWLh7CGbiKrTztLcU/edit#slide=id.g44b02ef8a3_0_220)

## Function w/ Parameters

You can also think of it as an input and output. So the function with a name can receive parameters, then perform some operations, then give back an output. Those parantheses `()` are there to receive the parameters. Here's an example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  const result = a + b;
  return result;
}
```

In this code, the function receives two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameters are `let` variables, but their value comes from when the function is called, as you'll see next. What's written after the `return` keyword will be returned to where the function was called. Here's how you'd use such a function:

```javascript
const result = add(3, 5);
console.log(result); // 8
```

How this'll work is that the parameter `a` will be assigned the value `3`, because when calling the function we put the number `3` first, then second is number `5`, which will be assigned to the second parameter `b`. Then the `add()` function will add the two number resulting in `8`, then the number `8` will be _`return`ed_.

When the number `8` is _`return`ed_, the code will evaluate to this:

```javascript
const result = 8;
console.log(result); // 8
```

**_Where you called the function will be replaced with the value it returned._**

Review notes: missing concept: 
- Passing variables into a function
- The variables' names can be different than the argument (this always confused students)
- Calling the same function more than once but with different passed arguments
