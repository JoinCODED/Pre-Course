# What is programming?

Programming is using many predefined commands that the computer understands, similar to the single-line commands we used in the Terminal, and putting them together in a text file.

All the applications we'll build will be collections of text files with many lines of these predefined commands.

# Introduction To JavaScript

We'll learn to build web and mobile apps using the programming language JavaScript. But before we start building the apps, in the Foundations phase we'll learn the basics of JavaScript.

During this period, you'll write your code in a file with the `.js` extension, and will see the result of the program in the _console_.

In VS Code, you can open the Terminal by pressing `CMD` (or `CTRL` on Windows) and `` ` ``. Or on the menu: `Terminal` > `New Terminal`. We'll use this Terminal to run our code and see the result. This Terminal will display the console when we run our JavaScript code.

## Brief History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in the mid-90's. It's created to build interactive web pages. But since then JS is used almost everywhere, even where there isn't a browser. It's given a name resembling "Java" to ride Java's popularity when it was first created. But Java is to JavaScript what car is to carpet. There's no relation whatsoever.

## Programming Basics

Let's start off writing a line of code (a statement) to print a simple message to the console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

The `console.log` part is a predefined command in the JavaScript language. We can use it to print a message to the console. The bit in the quotation marks `" "` is a data type called a **_string_**. Which the computer treats as just normal text. So in these quotation marks, you can write any normal text you'd like, and it'll be displayed in the console because of the `console.log` part.

This line of code will display the words "`Hello World!`" to the console.

You can also write multiple lines of code. Like this:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Welcome to programming!");
```

The program will execute these lines one by one, starting from the top. So the code will display on the following output in the console:

```bash
Hello World!
Welcome to programming!
```

## More on `console.log`

We're not limited to text when printing to console. There's other data types, such as integers:

```javascript
console.log(5);
```

To expand on that, you can perform math:

```javascript
console.log(5 + 3); // 8
```

And more...

## Variables

Let's expand this further. Let's say I am printing the following messages:

```javascript
console.log("The GitHub username is TheMshary.");
console.log("TheMshary has 30 repositories.");
```

You can see that the username "`TheMshary`" is repeated multiple times here. What if I want to change my username? I have to re-write this change everywhere the username is repeated. This can be made simpler by storing the username in one place, and re-using it. So we'll use something called a **_variable_** to store the username.

### Discuss `let` Variables Slides

Here's what the code looks like:

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log("The GitHub username is " + username);
console.log(username + " has 30 repositories.");
```

The output will be:

```bash
The GitHub username is TheMshary
TheMshary has 30 repositories.
```

Neat, huh? This is how you can concatenate a string with a variable. But there's another way, which we prefer much more. It's called _Template Literals_ (fancy name, I know,) using these backticks `` ` ` `` instead of quotation marks `" "`:

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);
```

In these backticks, you can type `${ }` and in between the curly brackets you can type in the name of the variable, as we did. The output of this code will be the same:

```bash
The GitHub username is TheMshary
TheMshary has 30 repositories.
```

You can define multiple variables, you're not limited to just one variable in your code.

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";
let numberOfRepositories = 30;

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}`);
console.log(`${username} has ${numberOfRepositories} repositories.`);
```

## Modifying The Variable

It's called a "variable" for a reason: you can change its value. Here's an example of how to do that:

```javascript
let username = "TheMshary";
let numberOfRepositories = 30;

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has ${numberOfRepositories} repositories.`);

username = "Lailz";

console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has ${numberOfRepositories} repositories.`);
```

The output of this will be:

```bash
The GitHub username is TheMshary
TheMshary has 30 repositories.
The GitHub username is Lailz
Lailz has 30 repositories.
```

The code will define the variable `username` with the value `"TheMshary"`, then print the two messages. Then change the value of `username` to `"Lailz"`, then print the two messages with the username changed.

## JavaScript Inside Template Literal

Since Lailz always has one more repository than I do, we can **perform math** _inside the Template Literal_:

```javascript
[...]

username = "Lailz";

console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has ${numberOfRepositories + 1} repositories.`);
```

The output of this will be:

```bash
The GitHub username is TheMshary
TheMshary has 30 repositories.
The GitHub username is Lailz
Lailz has 31 repositories.
```

## Constants (`const`)

There's another way to store a value, using `const`.

### Discuss `const` Slides

Here's the same example using `const` instead of `let`:

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

// username = "Lailz";
// console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
// console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

Works the same. However, using `const` means you can't change the value later on. So if we try to...

```javascript
const username = "TheMshary";

console.log(`The GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 30 repositories.`);

username = "Lailz"; // goes kaboom
console.log(`The new GitHub username is ${username}.`);
console.log(`${username} has 31 repositories.`);
```

...the program will crash.
