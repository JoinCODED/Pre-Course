# Git

## Discussion

### Topics to discuss:

- What is git?
- Git flow that we'll be using for tasks.

In this class, you'll learn the basic usage of `git` that you'll start using almost immediately. Later on in the bootcamp you'll learn more about `git`. But for now, we're keeping it simple.

# What is git?

![Commit History](https://i.imgur.com/4lK3jhC.jpg)

`Git` is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time.

`Git` records those changes and gives you the ability to go back to a previous version of your project.

Imagine you have a sketchbook and you're drawing a picture of a person. You just finished drawing the head. Next, you start drawing the body. However, after you finished, you didn't like how the body looks. With `git`, you can revert your drawing of the body and go back to the point where you just finished the head and start again from that point.

This is what `git` allows you to do.

# Git flow for tasks

Using [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/pre-course-git) as an example:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone it in your `Development` directory.
3. Create a new file

   ```bash
   $ touch example.txt
   ```

4. Add all the files

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```

5. Commit all the changes

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "MSG"
   ```

6. Push the changes to the remote repository

   ```bash
   $ git push
   ```

7. See changes on GitHub.
