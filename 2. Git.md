# Git

## Discussion

### Topics to discuss:

- What is git?
- Git flow that we'll be using for tasks.

In this class, you'll learn the basic usage of git that you'll start using almost immediately. Later on in the bootcamp you'll learn more about git. But for now, we're keeping it simple.

# What is git?

![Commit History](https://i.imgur.com/4lK3jhC.jpg)

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time.

Git records those changes and gives you the ability to go back to a previous version of your project.

Imagine you have a sketchbook and you're drawing a picture of a person. You just finished drawing the head. Next, you start drawing the body. However, after you finished, you didn't like how the body looks. With git, you can revert your drawing of the body and go back to the point where you just finished the head and start again from that point.

This is what git allows you to do.

# Git flow for tasks

Using [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/pre-course-git) as an example:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone it in your `Development` directory.
3. Create a new file

   ```bash
   $ touch example.txt
   ```

4. Add all the files

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```

5. Commit all the changes

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "MSG"
   ```

6. Push the changes to the remote repository

   ```bash
   $ git push
   ```

7. See changes on GitHub.

(Review note: it's not clear what add, commit and push are doing)
